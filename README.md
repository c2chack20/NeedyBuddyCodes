## Short description

### What's the problem?

Part of the World Health Organization's guidance and initiative taken by Govt of India, the whole country is under locked down to practice social distancing inorder to limit further spread of COVID-19. As a result, people are forced to stay at home with limited resource to live. People who stay alone or the ones's with oldage are most affected by this lockdown and needs both physical help and psychological help.

### How can technology help?

People can nominate themselves as volunteer who has capability to help people in need (either in physical form or psychological help). With the help of technology, Needy people who needs urgent help can contact people nearby volunteers based on the type of help they needs. Technology can filter all the volunteers staying nearby who can help and display a list of potential volunteers for you to contact them.

### The idea

The Idea is to connect Needy with the potential nearby volunteers with proper filter based of the type of help one needs.
